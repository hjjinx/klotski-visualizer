A tool to play, create, and visualize Klotski games.

This was made as an inspiration from this amazing video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGLNyHd2w10.

Select a puzzle and click `Analyze` to view the search space for your current position in the puzzle. If a solution is found within the selected number of nodes (from the left), you can simulate a win by clicking the button on top right and follow through a win.

Green edges represent edges that lead to a winning node, and green nodes present winning nodes.

*If your computer hangs, try **reducing the number of nodes**, and **tick** `Show Winning Path Only`*
